Fake new Classification

This project is about detecting whether a news is fake or not.

there are 3 ipython notebooks and app.py.

App.py is for deployment using flask app

part1 is where fake news Classification is implemented using machine learning models like logistic regression and XGboost

Part2 is where we use models like LSTM  and Bidirectional RNN to implement our task

part3 is where we try to use SOTA BERT for text Classification

Also lime has been used for interpreting the results.
